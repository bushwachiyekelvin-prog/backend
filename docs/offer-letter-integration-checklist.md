# Offer Letter Integration Checklist

## Overview
This checklist outlines the complete integration of the offer letter workflow into the loan approval audit trail system. The offer letter system currently exists but is not integrated with the main workflow and uses simulated DocuSign integration.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented
- [x] **Database Schema**: `offerLetters` table with DocuSign fields
- [x] **Service Layer**: `OfferLettersService` with CRUD operations
- [x] **API Routes**: `offer-letters.routes.ts` with endpoints
- [x] **Status Enums**: `offer_letter_sent`, `offer_letter_signed` in loan application status
- [x] **Basic Validation**: Loan application must be approved to create offer letters

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- [ ] **Real DocuSign Integration**: Currently simulated with fake envelope IDs
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: No actual email sending to recipients
- [ ] **Status Transition Integration**: Not connected to main loan workflow
- [ ] **Audit Trail Integration**: No logging of offer letter actions
- [ ] **Snapshot Integration**: Offer letters not included in snapshots
- [ ] **Document Generation**: No PDF creation for offer letters

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Complete loan approval ‚Üí offer letter ‚Üí signing ‚Üí disbursement workflow
- [ ] Real DocuSign integration with actual document signing
- [ ] Email notifications for all offer letter events
- [ ] Complete audit trail for offer letter actions
- [ ] Snapshot creation including offer letter data

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New integration tests pass

---

## Notes

- The current offer letter system is a database simulation and needs complete integration
- DocuSign integration is the most complex part and requires careful API handling
- Email notifications should use the existing NotificationService
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Testing is critical due to the complexity of the integration
