# Loan Approval Audit Trail Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating an immutable audit trail system for the loan approval process, from application submission to disbursement. The system will track all actions, create snapshots at approval points, and maintain a complete history for compliance and audit purposes.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing System
- **Personal Documents**: Uploaded during user onboarding, stored in `personalDocuments` table
- **Business Documents**: Uploaded during business profile creation, stored in `businessDocuments` table
- **Business Profiles**: Created during onboarding, stored in `businessProfiles` table
- **Loan Applications**: Created when users apply for loans, stored in `loanApplications` table
- **Offer Letters**: Generated and managed through DocuSign integration

### Current Gaps
- No audit trail for document changes
- No immutable snapshots at approval points
- No tracking of who made decisions and why
- No versioning system for documents
- No compliance reporting capabilities

## Design Decisions

### 1. Approval Approach: Loan-Level Approval
- **Single admin approval** for entire loan application
- **One snapshot** created at loan approval containing all approved documents
- **Simpler workflow** compared to document-level approvals
- **Clear audit trail** with single approval point

### 2. Snapshot Strategy
- **Single snapshot** at loan approval
- **Contains only approved documents** (personal + business)
- **Includes business profile** and application details
- **Immutable record** for compliance

### 3. Data Retention
- **Active applications**: Keep indefinitely
- **Approved loans**: 7 years
- **Failed applications**: 3 years
- **Audit trail**: 7 years for approved, 3 years for failed

### 4. Email Notifications
- **Status change notifications** (to be implemented later)
- **Approval notifications**
- **Disbursement notifications**

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Application Audit Trail
Tracks all actions throughout the loan lifecycle:
- Application creation and updates
- Document uploads and changes
- Admin review actions
- Approval decisions
- Disbursement activities

#### 2. Loan Application Snapshots
Immutable records created at loan approval:
- Complete document state at approval time
- Business profile data
- Application details
- Timestamps and user attribution

#### 3. Enhanced Document Management
- Document versioning and change tracking
- Approval workflow integration
- Snapshot creation at approval

## Database Schema Design

### 1. Application Audit Trail Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE application_audit_trail (
  id VARCHAR(24) PRIMARY KEY,
  loan_application_id VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES loan_applications(id),
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'application_created', 'documents_reviewed', 'loan_approved', etc.
  user_id VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  reason TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  before_data JSONB,
  after_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Loan Application Snapshots Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE loan_application_snapshots (
  id VARCHAR(24) PRIMARY KEY,
  loan_application_id VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES loan_applications(id),
  snapshot_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- Complete state at approval
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  approval_stage VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'loan_approved'
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Loan Applications Table
```sql
-- Add new columns to existing loan_applications table
ALTER TABLE loan_applications ADD COLUMN status_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE loan_applications ADD COLUMN last_updated_by VARCHAR(24) REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE loan_applications ADD COLUMN last_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
```

### 4. Document Requests Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_requests (
  id VARCHAR(24) PRIMARY KEY,
  loan_application_id VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES loan_applications(id),
  document_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending' | 'fulfilled'
  created_by VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  fulfilled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  fulfilled_with VARCHAR(24) REFERENCES business_documents(id) OR personal_documents(id)
);
```

## Workflow Design

### 1. Loan Application Process
```
User creates application → Audit trail: 'application_created'
User uploads documents → Audit trail: 'documents_uploaded'
User submits application → Audit trail: 'application_submitted'
Admin reviews application → Audit trail: 'application_under_review'
Admin requests documents → Document request created + Email notification
User uploads requested documents → Audit trail: 'documents_uploaded' + Request fulfilled
Admin approves loan → Audit trail: 'loan_approved' + Snapshot created + Email notification
Loan disbursed → Audit trail: 'disbursement_completed'
```

### 2. Document Request Process
```
Admin identifies missing documents → Document request created
User receives email notification → User uploads documents
System marks request as fulfilled → Audit trail entry created
Admin continues review process
```

### 3. Snapshot Creation Process
```
Admin approves loan → 
  - Create snapshot with all documents at approval time
  - Include business profile data
  - Include application details
  - Create audit trail entry
  - Send approval notification
```

## API Design

### 1. Audit Trail Endpoints
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/audit-trail` - Full audit trail
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/audit-trail/summary` - Summary view
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/snapshot` - Loan approval snapshot

### 2. Document Request Endpoints
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/document-requests` - Get document requests
- `POST /loan-applications/{id}/document-requests` - Create document request
- `PUT /document-requests/{id}/fulfill` - Mark request as fulfilled
- `GET /document-requests/{id}` - Get specific request

### 3. Loan Application Endpoints
- `POST /loan-applications/{id}/approve` - Approve loan (creates snapshot)
- `POST /loan-applications/{id}/reject` - Reject loan
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/status` - Get current status
- `GET /loan-applications/{id}/snapshot` - Approval snapshot
- `PUT /loan-applications/{id}/status` - Update status
